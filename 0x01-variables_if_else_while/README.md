In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean
operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type
`char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, using `if` and `if...else` statements, and
implementing `while` loops.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

**0**. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
   --------------------------------------------------
- This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c)
- The variable `n` will store a different value every time you will run this program
- You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
- The number, followed by
- if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
- if the number is 0: `is zero`
- if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
- followed by a new line

**1. The last digit**
- This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `n`.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c)
- The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program
- You don’t have to understand what `rand`, `srand`, and `RAND_MAX` do. Please do not touch this code
- The output of the program should be:
- The string `Last digit` of, followed by
- `n`, followed by
- the string is, followed by
- if the last digit of `n` is greater than `5`: the string `and is greater than 5`
